    description: |
      Define images to be pulled from registry. Each image should specify a `name`
      attribute.  Images can optionally provide `auth` if using a private registry.
      The value of `auth` must be base64 encoded user:password to the private 
      registry for that image.  Images can optionally also provide `retagAs` if
      it is desired to change an image's tag after pulling.
    example:
      images:
      - name: harbor.mydomain.com/debian-base:v2.0.0
        auth: dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
        retagAs: registry.k8s.io/debian-base:v2.0.0
      - name: harbor.mydomain.com/nginx
        auth: dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
